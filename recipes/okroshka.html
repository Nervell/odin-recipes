    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite dish is Okroshka. This soup is originated in the Eastern Europe regions and especially popular during summer due to light, cold and refreshing qualities. This recipe was 
        taken from this <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/okroshka-recipe-russian-summer-soup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 cups cold water</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>3 1/2 Tbsp Vinegar divided</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tsp Salt</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp chopped dill (fresh or frozen)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup green onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 ham diced</li>
        <li>3-4 medium cooked potatoes, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>3 hard-boiled eggs, diced</li>
        <li>3-4 cucumbers, diced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel potatoes and dice them into 1/4â€³ cubes. Place diced potatoes in a medium pot and cover with water. Add 1 Tbsp vinegar and bring to a 
            boil then continue boiling for 10 minutes or until the potatoes are cooked, but not falling apart.
            <br> Drain well and set aside to cool. For quicker cooling, you can rinse potatoes with cold water.</li>
        <li>While potatoes are cooking , boil 3 eggs and cooled them in ice water.</li>
        <li>Next, dice 3 eggs, 3-4 cucumbers, and 1/2 lb of ham. Also chop 3 Tbsp of dill and 1/2 cup of green onions. Place everything in a large pot.</li>
        <li>In a separate large bowl, whisk together 8 cups of cold water, 1/3 cup of sour cream, 2 1/2 Tbsp of vinegar, 2 1/2 tsp of salt until combined. 
            Pour the mixture in the pot with the rest of ingredients. Stir to combine and serve.</li>
