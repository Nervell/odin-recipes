    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Pelmeni are a type of dumpling of Russian cuisine, considered a national dish. They are often boiled or pan-fried and commonly served with sour cream, butter, or in a broth. 
        They can be enjoyed as a main course, added to soups, and even served for breakfast or dessert with various accompaniments like applesauce, jam, or chocolate.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the dough:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose or Italian '00' flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>7 tablespoons water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the filling and serving:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 small yellow onion, very finely diced</li>
        <li>4 ounces ground beef</li>
        <li>4 ounces ground pork</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for cooking</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf (optional)</li>
        <li>1 stock cube, such as Knorr Vegetable Stock (optional)</li>
        <li>Serving options: sour cream, chopped fresh dill, butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Make the dough:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the flour and salt. Place 2 1/2 cups flour and 1 teaspoon kosher salt in a large bowl and stir with a fork to combine.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs and water. Create a deep well in the middle of the flour. Crack 1 large egg and add 7 tablespoons water into the well. Whisk the eggs with the fork to combine.</li>
        <li>Begin combining the flour and wet ingredients. As you whisk the eggs, begin gradually pulling in flour from the bottom and sides of the bowl. Don't rush this step. At first, the eggs will start to look like a slurry. 
            Once enough flour has been added, it will start forming a very soft dough. Don't worry if you haven't used all the flour.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough. Turn the dough and any excess flour out onto a clean work surface. Begin gently folding the dough on itself, flattening, and folding again. It will be extremely soft at first, then gradually start to firm up. 
            Once it's firm enough to knead, begin kneading the dough until it forms a firm, smooth, elastic ball, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Wrap and chill the dough. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the filling.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Make the filling:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop the onion. Very finely chop 1 small yellow onion and place in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Make the filling. Add 4 ounces ground beef, 4 ounces ground pork, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1 teaspoon black pepper and mix until thoroughly combined. Refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Make the wrappers and form the pelmeni:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Divide the dough. Divide the dough into 4 portions, then form each into a ball. Flatten each ball into disk.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough into sheets. Working with 1 disk at a time, pass through a pasta machine through the thickest setting. Repeat passing through the machine, incrementally going up in each setting, 
            until the sheet is about 1.5mm thin and almost see-through (setting 6 or 7 on a manual machine).</li>
        <li>Cut out 2-inch dough rounds. As each sheet is ready, cut out rounds with a 2-inch round cutter. Place each round on a clean kitchen towel in a single layer without touching. Cover each layer 
            with a kitchen towel. After rolling out all the disks, gather the scraps and re-roll and cut until you have about 100 dough rounds.</li>
        <li>Add the filling. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and have a small bowl of cold water ready. Place 1 teaspoon filling in the middle of a dough round.</li>
        <li>Fold the pelmeni. Dip a finger in cold water and trace the top edges of the dough round. Fold in half to make a half-moon shape, pressing against the edges so that they seal. Fold the two ends 
            toward each other until they overlap slightly, then press so that they stick together. (Use some water here as well if they don't stick together.)</li>
        <li>Repeat folding. Place on the baking sheet and repeat with the remaining dough rounds and filling, placing them in a single layer without touching. 
            When the baking sheet is full, place a sheet of parchment paper on the first layer and top with more pelmeni.</li>
        <li>Cook or freeze. The pelmeni can be cooked immediately, refrigerated for a few hours, or frozen to be cooked at a later date.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cook the pelmeni:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring water to a boil. Boil a large pot of salted water, adding bay leaf and a stock cube if desired.</li>
        <li>Cook the pelmeni in batches. Place 15 to 20 pelmeni into the boiling broth and cook for 5 minutes. You know they are ready when they float up to the surface.</li>
        <li>Serve the pelmeni. Transfer the pelmeni using a slotted spoon into soup bowls. Repeat with the remaining pelmeni. Top with butter, fresh dill, sour cream, and black pepper. 
            If you prefer to have them with the cooking liquid, ladle it over the pelmeni and garnish with fresh dill and black pepper.</li>
    </ol>
