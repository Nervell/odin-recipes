    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kvass is a traditional fermented beverage from Eastern Europe, typically made from rye bread, water, and sugar.
        It has a mildly sweet, slightly tangy flavor and is often enjoyed as a refreshing, probiotic-rich drink. Current recipy is taken from this

    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>0.5-1 pound (227-454 g) rye (or other) bread</li>
        <li>1 gallon (3.78 L) water</li>
        <li>1.5 cups (300 g) sugar (I like to use brown sugar, but honey is okay, too)</li>
        <li>Small handful dried herb(s), for flavoring (usually dried mint, but I've seen basil, thyme, or rosemary used)</li>
        <li>0.4 ounce (12 g) raisins</li>
        <li>0.5-0.75 cup (120-180 ml) wild yeast starter or commercial beer yeast</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the bread and break the slices into smaller pieces. Place them in a preheated 350°F (177°C)
             oven for 10 minutes, then broil on high until golden brown—this can take 3 to 5 minutes depending on your oven. You basically want your bread to look 
             like slightly overdone toast, which will give the brew a nice amber look and better flavors.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, pour the water and sugar into a pot and bring the liquid to a boil. Place the toasted bread, herbs, and raisins in the 
            boiling liquid and stir briefly. Bring the liquid back to a boil, then remove the pot from the heat.</li>
        <li>Place the pot (with the lid on) in cold water and cool the liquid to 70°F (21°C), then add the yeast (½ to ¾ cup or 120-180 ml for wild yeast starter). 
            Either keep everything in the original pot with the lid on or transfer the contents into a fermenting bucket fitted with an airlock or a clay pot/glass 
            container with a clean towel on top.</li>
        <li>Ferment for around 8 to 12 hours, until you see some bubbling going on, then strain the liquid into a bottle or into recycled soda bottles 
            if you want carbonation. Check the pressure and place the bottles in the refrigerator when ready. Drink within a couple of weeks.</li>
    </ol>
